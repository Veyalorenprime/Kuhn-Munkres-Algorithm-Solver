# Kuhn-Munkres-Algorithm
## Description
This Python program solves the assignment problem using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, also known as the Hungarian method. The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that finds the optimal assignment in polynomial time.

## Features
- Accepts input matrix for the assignment problem
- Provides a user-friendly interface to input the matrix values
- Includes an option to parse a string representation of the matrix
- Outputs the optimal assignment solution

## Usage
1. Define the size of the input matrix.
2. Enter the values of the matrix.
3. Click the "Solve" button to get the optimal assignment solution.
4. Alternatively, you can provide a string representation of the matrix and click the "Parser" button to parse the input.

The program will display the optimal assignment solution based on the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.
